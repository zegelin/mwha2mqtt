# The serial port baud rate.

# Values other that 9600 (amp power-on default) or "auto" require the amp to already be configured to use the specified baud before mwha2mqttd starts
# You probably want "auto".
baud = 9600

# Whether to adjust the amp and port baud rates once connected.
# One of "off", 9600, 19200, 38400, 57600, 115200, 230400 or "max" can be specified.

[mqtt]
# URL of the MQTT server.
# 'mqtt' and 'mqtts' schemes are supported, for unencrypted and TLS-encrypted MQTT connections respectivly.
# Websockets are currently not supported.
# A port number can be specified to use something other than the default (1883 for 'mqtt', 8883 for 'mqtts').
# A port number cannot be specified if srv_lookup is true (the port number comes from the SRV record).
# A username/password can be specified if required by the server.
# The URL path, if present, is used as a prefix to all topic names.
# If no path is specified (i.e. no '/' is present after the host/port) the default prefix of 'mwha/' will be used.
# Use '/' to mean no prefix. Start the path with '//' if you want all topic names to start with a slash (e.g. '//mwah/'
# means a prefix of '/mwha/').
# You probably want the path to end in '/' (unless you want topic names such as 'mwha_status', for which you'd use a
# path of '/mwha_').

[amp]
# The interval between each poll to the amp for zone status information.
# Lower values reduce the delay between adjusting zone attributes via physical keypads and MQTT clients receiving these
